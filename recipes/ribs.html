    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This slow cooker baby back ribs recipe was originally shared by Norah and has since become a favorite among home cooks everywhere. With thousands of glowing reviews, it’s loved for being both simple and delicious — the kind of “set it and forget it” meal that delivers fall-apart tender ribs with almost no effort. Finished in the oven for that sticky, caramelized barbecue glaze, these ribs prove you don’t need a grill to make a crowd-pleasing classic.</p>
